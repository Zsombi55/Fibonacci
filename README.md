This is an exercise from the Catalysts Coding Contest webpage.

The goal is finding the n-th number of the provided Fibonacci sequence final result(s).

Using the Golden Ratio:  F_n = Phi^n / sqrt(5)  generally rounded up.

Excerpt from the test instructions::
> The Fibonacci sequence  (F_0, F_1, ...)  is due to the recursive law of formation  (F_0 = F_n-1 + F_n-2)
> for  (n >= 2) with the initial values  (F_0 = 0)  and  (F_1 = 1)  are defined.
> [...] the first numbers are Zero and One respectively, and each additional number is the sum of their predecessors. Examples:
>
> * n = 0 -> 0
> * n = 1 -> 1
> * n = 2 -> 1
> * n = 3 -> 2
> * n = 4 -> 3
> * n = 5 -> 5
